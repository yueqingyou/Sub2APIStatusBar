## Release Commands

```bash
swift test
swift build
VERSION=v0.1.5 ./scripts/package-release.sh
VERSION=v0.1.5 ./scripts/verify-release.sh
```

Developer ID signing:

```bash
SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
VERSION=v0.1.5 \
./scripts/package-release.sh
```

Notarization requires Apple Developer account credentials and is intentionally not automated until those secrets are available in GitHub Actions or the local keychain.

```bash
APPLE_ID="you@example.com" \
TEAM_ID="TEAMID" \
APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" \
SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
VERSION=v0.1.5 \
./scripts/notarize-release.sh
```
